Perseus reference server
========================

Perseus is Nebulon's refence server implementation.

It currently provides two transport protocols - REST and GRPC -
for providing access to the configured BlockStorage backend.

For configuration example see [testbed config file](../../tests/perseus.conf.yaml).
